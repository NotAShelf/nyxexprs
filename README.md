## Usage

### NixOS/Home-manager (flakes)

It is as simple as adding a new entry to your inputs with the correct url.

```nix
# flake.nix
inputs = {
    # ...
    nyxpkgs.url = "github:notashelf/nyxpkgs";
    # ...
};
```

After adding the input, you can consume the [exposed packages](#packages) in your system configuration.
An example `flake.nix` would be as follows:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    home-manager.url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";

    nyxpkgs.url = "github:notashelf/nyxpkgs";
  };

  outputs = inputs @ {self, nixpkgs, ...}: {
    # set up for NixOS
    nixosConfigurations.<yourHostName> = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      specialArgs = {inherit inputs;};
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
        # ...
      ];
    };

    # or for Home Manager
    homeConfigurations.<yourHostName> = inputs.home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
      extraSpecialArgs = {inherit inputs;};

      pkgs = import nixpkgs {
        system = "x86_64-linux";
        config.allowUnfree = true;
      };

      modules = [
        ./home.nix
        # ...
      ];
    }
  };
}
```

Where you can then add the relevant package to your `environment.systemPackages` or `home.packages`

```nix
{pkgs, inputs, ...}: {
  # in case of home-manager, this will be home.packages
  environment.systemPackages = [
    inputs.nyxpkgs.packages.${pkgs.system}.<packageName> # installs a package
  ];
}
```

### Nix

If you are using Nix on a non-NixOS distro, you may `nix run` to try out packages, or `nix profile install` to
install them on your system profile. If using home-manager on non-NixOS, I recommend using `home.packages` instead.

```console
nix profile install github:notashelf/nyxpkgs#<package>
```

### NixOS/Home-manager (no flakes)

If you are not using flakes, the above instructions will not apply. You may obtain the source as a tarball to
consume in your system configuration as follows:

```nix
{pkgs, ...}: let
  nyxpkgs = import (builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/notashelf/nyxpkgs/archive/main.tar.gz");
in {
  # install packages
  # this can also be home.packages if you are using home-manager
  environment.systemPackages = [
    nyxpkgs.packages.${pkgs.hostPlatform.system}.<packageName>
  ];
}
```

## ðŸ“¦ Packages

There are several packages exposed by this flake. Each directory in `pkgs` contains a description of the package inside its README.

| Package          |                                            Description                                             |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| ani-cli          |                           An up-to-date, auto updated version of ani-cli                           |
| cloneit          |                    A CLI tool to download specific GitHub directories or files                     |
| foot-transparent |    A patched version of the foot terminal emulator that brings back fullscreen transparency[^1]    |
| rat              | Linux shell port of the horizontally spinning rat meme, complete with soundtrack and spin counter. |
| reposilite-bin   |                         A derivation for the reposilite maven repository.                          |

[^1]: Foot has broken fullscreen transparency on 1.15, which looks **really** ugly with padding. The author is dead set on not fixing it, because it's broken on one wayland compositor that a total of 7 people use.
