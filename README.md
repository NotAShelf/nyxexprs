# ðŸŒ™ nyxexprs

My personal package overlay for sharing my most commonly used derivations. Kept
up to date with Github workflows and npins. Contributions welcome.

## Usage

All packages in Nyxexprs are exposed in the flake outputs.

### Flakes

```nix
# flake.nix
inputs = {
    # Add an input as such. Avoid adding "follows" lines if you would
    # like to benefit from the binary cache.
    nyxexprs.url = "github:notashelf/nyxexprs";
    # ...
};
```

If you are using Nix on a non-NixOS distro, you may nix run to try out packages,
or `nix profile install` to install them on your system profile. If using
home-manager on non-NixOS, I recommend using `home.packages` instead.

### Binary Cache

Regardless of your setup,you may want to add the
[binary cache](https://app.cachix.org/cache/nyx) to your substituters to avoid
building the provided packages on each pull. You may follow the example below to
add the binary cache to your system.

```nix
nix.settings = {
    builders-use-substitutes = true;
    substituters = [
        # other substituters
        "https://nyx.cachix.org"
    ];

    trusted-public-keys = [
        # other trusted keys
        "nyx.cachix.org-1:xH6G0MO9PrpeGe7mHBtj1WbNzmnXr7jId2mCiq6hipE="
    ];
};
```
